# --------------------------------------------------------------- teardown -----
# The exploit stages its temporary su at $SU_SHADOW_DIR/su, on a tmpfs it mounts
# over that apex bin dir (cves/cve-2026-43499-ghostlock/preload.c:ensure_su_mount),
# and it does so inside *adbd's* mount namespace so `adb shell` sees it. That directory precedes
# /system/bin in the shell PATH, so the temp su shadows every other `su` for the
# rest of the boot. Late-load tears the temp-su daemon down but leaves the binary
# and the mount behind. A plain `adb shell su` then execs an orphaned
# client whose daemon is gone and fails with "connect daemon: Permission denied",
# which reads as "root is broken" even though the driver is live and the manager
# has root. The tmpfs also hides the apex's real binaries (crosvm, virtmgr, vm,
# fd_server, ...), leaving AVF/Terminal broken until the mount is dropped.
#
# Requires globals: DEV_SU DEV_KSU_SU DEV_TMP SU_SHADOW_DIR.

# bare `su`: while the shadow is still up, bare `su` resolves through it to the
# exploit's temp su, whose daemon late-load is tearing down right now. It can
# still answer `id` for the moment its daemon is alive and then be dead by the
# umount a beat later ("su: connect daemon: Permission denied") -- and using the
# temp su to unmount the temp su is self-defeating anyway. So only the fixed
